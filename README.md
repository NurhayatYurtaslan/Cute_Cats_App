<p>This project includes an application for managing cute cats using BloC (Business Logic Component).</p>

<p>The application allows users to add, remove, and load the cat counter. The status of the cats changes when a specific event occurs, providing the user with the updated state.</p>

<p>The project is developed using Flutter and Dart, and it follows the BloC architecture. BloC is a design pattern used to manage the state of an application and handle user interactions.</p>

<p>This app is a great starting point for those learning mobile app development with Flutter. It's ideal for learning how to manage application state using the BloC architecture.</p>
